# 🍔 MERN Food Delivery App

A full-stack **Food Delivery Web Application** built with the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js).  
The app allows users to browse food items, add them to the cart, place orders, and make payments.  
An **Admin Panel** is also available for managing food items and orders.

> ⚠️ Backend APIs are hosted separately on Render free tier, so the **first request may take a few seconds to wake up the server**.
